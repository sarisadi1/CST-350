<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<p>Minesweeper is a game where you need to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without triggering any of them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click on a cell to reveal it.</li>
    <li>If the cell contains a mine, the game is over.</li>
    <li>If the cell is empty, it will reveal the number of mines in adjacent cells.</li>
    <li>Your goal is to reveal all non-mine cells without clicking on any mines.</li>
